## Task2
This is a program that adds numbers from 1 to N in parallel.

The number N is specified by the startup argument.

Load balancing is done using the *schedule* directive.

The final result (summing up the results of all threads) is obtained using the *reduction* directive.

The execution time is also measured here. Just for fun.
